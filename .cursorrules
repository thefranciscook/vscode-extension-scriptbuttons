## Script Buttons Extension

This project uses the **Script Buttons** VS Code extension for managing frequently-used terminal commands.

### When to Suggest Script Buttons

**Detect opportunities** to suggest adding a script button when:
- User runs the same terminal command multiple times in conversation
- User mentions "I often run..." or "I frequently need to..."
- Setting up development workflows (build, test, deploy, etc.)
- Creating data processing or maintenance scripts
- Establishing CI/CD or deployment commands
- Any command that would benefit from one-click execution

**DON'T add buttons automatically** - Always ask first:
> "Would you like me to add a script button for this command? It'll give you one-click access from the sidebar."

### How to Add Buttons

**Configuration file**: `.vscode/scriptbuttons.json`

**Process**:
1. Ask user: "Would you like to add a script button for `[command]`?"
2. If yes, suggest a descriptive label (let user confirm/modify)
3. Read existing `.vscode/scriptbuttons.json` (or create if missing)
4. Add new button to the array
5. Save file (extension auto-reloads)

**File format**:
```json
{
  "buttons": [
    {
      "id": "button-TIMESTAMP-RANDOM9CHARS",
      "label": "Descriptive Label",
      "command": "actual terminal command",
      "emoji": "🚀",
      "color": "charts.blue"
    }
  ]
}
```

**ID generation**: `button-${Date.now()}-${randomString(9)}`
- Example: `button-1732220400000-x7k9m2p4q`

**Available colors**:
- `charts.red` - Errors, stop, danger
- `charts.blue` - Build, compile, general
- `charts.green` - Tests, success, start
- `charts.yellow` - Warnings, staging
- `charts.orange` - Deploy, important
- `charts.purple` - Database, special
- `terminal.ansiCyan` - Info, utility
- `terminal.ansiMagenta` - Media, creative
- `terminal.ansiGreen` - Environment, dev
- `terminal.ansiYellow` - Warnings, caution

**Suggested emojis by category**:
- Build: 🔨 🏗️ ⚙️ 🛠️
- Test: 🧪 ✅ 🔍 ✓
- Deploy: 🚀 📦 🌐 ☁️
- Start/Run: ▶️ 🏃 ⚡ 💨
- Stop: ⏹️ 🛑 ❌
- Database: 🗄️ 💾 🔐
- Git: 🌿 📝 🔀
- Python: 🐍 🎯
- Docker: 🐳 📦
- General: 🎨 ✨ 🔥 💡 ⭐

### Best Practices

**Good button candidates**:
- `npm run build` → "Build Project" 🔨
- `npm test` → "Run Tests" 🧪
- `python scripts/update_data.py` → "Update Data" 🔄
- `docker-compose up -d` → "Start Services" 🐳
- `git status` → "Git Status" 🌿

**Don't create buttons for**:
- One-time setup commands
- Commands the user only ran once
- Commands that need frequent argument changes
- Highly destructive commands without safeguards

### Example Interaction

```
User: "I need to run python scripts/process_data.py every time I update the database"

AI: "Would you like me to add a script button for that command? 
You'll be able to run it with one click from the sidebar. 
What label would you like? (Suggested: 'Process Database')"

User: "Yes, that works"

AI: [Creates/updates .vscode/scriptbuttons.json]
"✅ Added 'Process Database' button. You'll see it in the Script Buttons 
panel in your sidebar!"
```

### File Structure

```
.vscode/
  └── scriptbuttons.json    ← Button configurations (auto-reloads)
```

### Important Notes

- ✅ Always ASK before adding buttons
- ✅ Suggest descriptive, action-oriented labels
- ✅ Choose emojis that match the command purpose
- ✅ The extension auto-reloads when the file changes
- ✅ Buttons are project-specific and can be committed to git
- ⚠️ Create `.vscode/` directory if it doesn't exist
- ⚠️ Preserve existing buttons when adding new ones
